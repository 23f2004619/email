# Email Data Repository

## Overview

This repository provides a straightforward and lightweight solution for accessing a specific email address programmatically. The core of this repository is the `email.json` file, which contains a single email address. This setup is ideal for applications and scripts that require a configurable email address without the need for complex configuration files or environment variables.

The simplicity of this repository makes it easy to integrate into various projects, ensuring that the email address can be updated and accessed with minimal effort. It is particularly useful for automated systems, notification services, or any application where an email address needs to be maintained and retrieved consistently.

## JSON Data Structure

The `email.json` file has a very simple structure. It contains a single key-value pair:

```json
{
  "email": "23f2004619@ds.study.iitm.ac.in"
}
```

- **`email`**: This key holds the email address as a string.

## Usage

You can easily parse the `email.json` file in any programming language that supports JSON. Below are examples in Python and JavaScript.

### Python

```python
import json

with open('email.json', 'r') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
    email = data['email']
    print(f"The email address is: {email}")
```

### JavaScript (Node.js)

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('email.json', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
        console.error("Error reading the file:", err);
        return;
    }
    const jsonData = JSON.parse(data);
    const email = jsonData.email;
    console.log(`The email address is: ${email}`);
});
```
